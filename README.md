## Hi there 👋

I'm Kraiwich Vichakhot, or Pok, currently a student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), majoring in the Institute of Field Robotics (FIBO). I have a strong interest in ROS2, robotics, web, and IoT, and I'm continuously expanding my skills through hands-on projects and collaborations. Looking forward to connecting and learning together!
